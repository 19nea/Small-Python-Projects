# small-projects

This are some fun projects I do as of beginning of my coding path.

These projects vary in type — from basic utilities like password generators to mini games, tools, or experiments with libraries. They’re mostly made for fun and learning.

### 🔍 What’s inside?
Each file/folder is a standalone project. Some may be more complete than others — all are meant to be lightweight, simple, and self-contained.

### 📁 Structure
- Projects are placed directly in this repo, weather they are in a folder or file.
- Each project is commented internally for clarity, having comments explaining it.

### 💬 Why this repo?
To keep track of smaller projects, that I may or may not use again.
